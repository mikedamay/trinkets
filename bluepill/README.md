bluepill
========

A small avoider game, written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).  Compatible with v0.15

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can play it (and play with it) here: http://share-elm.com/sprout/53338cf8e4b0e548f36861bb

Avoid red pills, collect blue pills, and keep the dream alive. :)

This is my first Elm program.

If you're interested in learning Elm, you can give [my video tutorial series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PDvHveBtDQ&list=PLtdCJGSpculbDT_p4ED9oLTJQrzoM1QEL) a try; it covers the development of this very game.
