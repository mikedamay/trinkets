1) when I select a node-set do nodes on the axis which are not selected get picked up elsewhere?
Yes - there is no question of unselected nodes getting lost.

2) What is the context node in a template's match statement?

3) Is it true to say that apply-templates applies to a node and all its descendents?

4) The stylesheet processes the the node set before the next sibling node in document order is processed.
